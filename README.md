# Cell-Image-Segmentation
A cell image segmentation project based on machine learning or deep learning. Implement an deep learning based model U-Net, which is a fully convolutional Network to learn the cell image segmentation according to the training data i.e. Electron Microscopy (EM) images with a label which is a binary image based on manually segmentation. After the model has been trained, the accuracy of the segmentation reached over 98 percent. And DL is advantaged to ML method in an image processing task.
