# Cell-Image-Segmentation
A 4-people grouped project to implement a cell image segmentation based on machine learning or deep learning. My responsibilities are implementing an deep learning based model U-Net and post-processing, which is a fully convolutional Network to learn the cell image segmentation according to the training data i.e. Electron Microscopy (EM) images with a label which is a binary image based on manually segmentation. After the model has been trained, the accuracy of the segmentation reached over 98 percent. And DL is advantaged to ML method in an image processing task.

Project Instructions
The directory includes as following
1. Training data
2. U-Net model implemented on Jupyter Notebook
3. Project report
4. Referenced paper regards to the U-Net model implementation

To run the model need to install relevant python libraries.
